# PDXPOD - Coworking Concept

#### By William Chu

## Description

A project to sketch, wireframe, prototype and build a website for a mock cowork company.

Client requirements:

* "We just finished remodeling our space. We're really proud of it. We want our online presence to mirror our in-person presence, to attract people that would really enjoy working in our environment."

* "We want our space--no, our whole company--to feel a little luxurious, cool, and high-end; yet still absolutely 100% welcoming, approachable and inclusive to anyone and everyone. A safe, comfortable, and productive work environment, you know?"

* "I also think it's really important convey our unique personality. It's what sets us apart from the 'big guys' in the coworking field. You know, places like WeWork and TechSpace. We think we're more funky, more local, less corporate, and a little more fun."

* "I want to avoid catering to tech. You walk into some of these other coworking spaces, and you only ever see people working on code. That's great, but we'd also love to see artists, daytraders, writers, counselors, more traditional business people--you know, anyone and everyone--in our space."

* "It should also be easy to see what amenities we have. We have an on-site coffee counter, both communal working areas and private offices, high-speed internet, printing and faxing services, and we usually have a fun, optional activity on Thursday afternoons. Like yoga, maybe a fun complementary food, or like...I don't know, a craft or something?"

#### Verbal Branding

| Slogan | Messaging |
| ------ | ------- |
| "Just another coworking space? Tech No." | Invitation to potential PDXPOD clientele that may be turned off by a majority makeup of tech workers |
| "A Workspace for the Rest of Us" | Emphasizes PDXPOD's desire to cater to a diverse community of creators |
| "Coworking for Our Community" | PDXPOD wants to be part of the community to build loyalty amongst its members. This message can be used in conjunction with highlighting other local businesses or philanthropic activity that supports Portland, OR |

#### Organizations to Emulate:

PDXPOD is trying to differentiate itself from WeWork and other coworking spaces. To carve its own niche in the market, I believe they should be analyzing the business models and branding used by other local businesses that focus on serving clientele for specific crafts.
